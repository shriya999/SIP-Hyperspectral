This repository contains code for the work presented in the [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R4BYnAH3sTszLGDNKGalrz4amJd03MJu/view?usp=sharing).

The KNN, Parallelepiped, and Multi-Layer Perceptron algorithms are implemented using the Numpy and [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) libraries in Python. The graphical user interface has been developed using the [PyQt4](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt4/) library. 

The experiments have been carried out as described in the paper on the Indian Pines and Salinas Datasets.
